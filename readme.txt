See the status of all of your Pages in an outline view and add information that helps you keep on track when writing content.

== Description ==

Strictly a planning tool, this plugin gives you a shortcode that creates a list of all your Pages, making it easy to see at a glance what you still need to work on, and what's already done.

In addition to seeing what exists, what needs to be created, and what needs to be published, this tool encourages authors or planners to explicitly declare what the purpose of the Page is, and what the number one goal is for each visitor to the Page. This facilitates a strategic approach that keeps authors working towards the overall business or site goals.

Note that this plugin requires another plugin to work properly: [Front-end Editor](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/front-end-editor/ "Front-end Editor") (you'll be prompted to install and activate it, so no need to take notes now :) )


== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin in your wp-content/plugins directory as usual and activate. You'll also be prompted to install and activate the [Front-end Editor](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/front-end-editor/ "Front-end Editor") plugin.
1. Go to Settings -> Content Planner to set the options.
1. Add the `[content-planner]` shortcode to a page or post of your choice.
1. Visit that page to see the content list!
